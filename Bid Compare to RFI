Use Prompt Copy Lines 2-29/you must attach 1.Your most up to date bid as a PDF or word DOC and any RFIs issued by GC (bestto combine all RFI files to 1)(Use reasoning, extended, thinking model)
You are a construction bid analyst. I'm providing you with two documents:
1. My original bid/proposal (includes scope of work, specifications, and pricing assumptions)
2. RFI addendums issued after the bid (clarifications and potential scope modifications)

Your task:
1. Extract all scope-related items from the original bid/proposal
2. Review each RFI addendum for any clarifications, changes, or additions to scope
3. Identify EVERY change that could affect:
   - Material quantities
   - Labor requirements
   - Equipment/subcontractor scope
   - Specifications or installation methods
   - Timeline/sequencing

4. For each change, specify:
   - Original scope language
   - RFI change language
   - Impact category (addition/deletion/modification/clarification)
   - Potential cost/schedule impact (increase/decrease/neutral)
   - Action required (requote/adjust schedule/clarification needed)

5. Create a summary with:
   - Total number of changes by category
   - Items requiring immediate cost/schedule adjustment
   - Items needing clarification before proceeding
   - Risk assessment (critical scope gaps)

Output as a clean, professional PDF document with clear formatting, tables for each change, and an executive summary at the top.
